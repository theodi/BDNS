## Quick intro to myself...

::: {.incremental}
- MEP Engineer for 6 years at Max Fordham
  - Project Engineer on multiple projects delivered on-site
- Staggered by the inefficiencies in the design, construction and commissioning of Buildings
- Started writing code to automate various calculations and design processes on Projects
- That soon became my full-time job
- Now run a small team develeping software products focused on Engineering Delivery

## My Intro to BDNS

- A project asked for it to be used in a BEP (BIM Execution Plan)
- I was in the process of developing a product specification and cataloguing system (Digital Schedules)
- I wanted to try and standardise how equipment were named across projects
- I found the BDNS community to be active, supportive and willing to expand to satisfy new use cases
- My first commit was merged in Nov 2022

## BDNS at MF - Digital Schedules

## Schedules - old

## Digital Schedules - new

## Revit Properties

## AecSchedule App

![](images/revit-aecschedule-sync.png)

## Revit export data rich IFC

![](images/revit-export-ifc.png)

## aectemplater - data flow

- define templates / extend IFC classes

![](images/scope-aectemplater.png)

## aecschedule - data flow

- record project data against templates

![](images/scope-aecschedule.png)


## Custom Templates / Classes

We have extended the IFC classes to satisfy all scheduling needs. 
Sometimes that means a new class, sometimes that means extending an IFC class with extra properties.
Classes (/Templates) are given default BDNS abbreviations.

## Pain Points - Types and Instances

Instances: 

- main mech equipment (e.g. AHU, FAN etc. )
- main elec equipment (e.g. DB, PB etc.)

Not always clear which to use when.

## Pain Points - Customising references on Drawings

![](images/customising-references.png)


## Ongoing Work - bdns-plus

[bdns-plus](https://maxfordham.github.io/bdns-plus/)


## Desired Outcomes

- better definitions of the parameter names that build the reference
- description of which of those names should exist in the Revit model
  - e.g. "name", "id" ?


## Other stuff... tooling (more later...?)
