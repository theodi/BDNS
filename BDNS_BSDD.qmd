# BDNS on BSDD (Building Smart Data Dictionaries)

In the summer of 2025 there was a concerted effort between BDNS, IFC and Building Smart to add the BDNS abbreviations to the BSDD. 

ðŸš€ The dictionary is now available here: **[https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/bdns](https://identifier.buildingsmart.org/uri/bdns)** ðŸš€

## Keeping the BSDD up-to-date

There is a [plan to publish on tag...](https://github.com/theodi/BDNS/issues/365) but until that is ready please do the following:

1. Go to the built docs and download the bsdd import file: 
  - [https://github.com/theodi/BDNS/blob/gh-pages/bsdd-import-bdns.json](https://github.com/theodi/BDNS/blob/gh-pages/bsdd-import-bdns.json)
2. Go to the BSDD manage page and upload the file.
  - [https://manage.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/dictionaries](https://manage.bsdd.buildingsmart.org/dictionaries)

For info, the import json can be inspected here: 

```{ojs}
bsdd_import_bdns = await FileAttachment("tools/bsdd-import-bdns.json").json();
bsdd_import_bdns
```
